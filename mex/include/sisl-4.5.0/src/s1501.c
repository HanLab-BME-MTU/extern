* PURPOSE    : To march an intersection curve desribed by parameter pairs
*              in an intersection curve object, a B-spline surface and
*              an elliptic cone.
*
*
* INPUT      : ps1    - Pointer to surface.
*              base   - Base point of cone
*              norm   - Direction of cone axis
*              axisA  - One of the two ellipse axis vectors
*              alpha  - The opening angle of the cone at axisA
*              ratio  - The ratio of axisA to axisB
*              idim   - Dimension of the space in which the plane lies.
*              aepsco - Computational resolution.
*              aepsge - Geometry resolution.
*              amax   - Maximal allowed step length. If amax <=aepsge
*                       amax is neglected.
*              icur   - Indicator telling if a 3-D curve is to be made
*                        0 - Don't make 3-D curve
*                        1 - Make 3-D curve
*                        2 - Make 3-D curve and curves in parameter plane
*              igraph - Indicator telling if the curve is to be output
*                       through function calls:
*                        0 - don't output curve through function call
*                        1 - output as straight line segments through
*                            s6move and s6line.
*
*
*
* INPUT/OUTPUT:pintcr - The intersection curve. When coming as input
*                       only parameter values in the parameter plane
*                       exist. When coming as output the 3-D geometry
*                       and possibly the curve in the parameter plane
*                       of the surface are added.
*
* OUTPUT:      jstat  - status messages
*                         = 3      : Iteration stopped due to singular
*                                    point or degenerate surface. A part
*                                    of intersection curve may have been
*                                    traced out. If no curve is traced out
*                                    the curve pointers in the Intcurve
*                                    object point to SISL_NULL.
*                         = 0      : ok
*                         < 0      : error
*                         = -185   : No points produced on intersection curve.
*
*
* METHOD     : An implicit description of the cone is made and then
*              a routine for intersecting implicit represented geometry
*              by a B-spline surface is used.
