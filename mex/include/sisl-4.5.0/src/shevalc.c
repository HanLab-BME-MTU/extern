*********************************************************************
*
* PURPOSE    : To compute the value and ider first derivatives of the
*              B-spline curve pointed to by pc1, at the point with
*              parameter value ax. Use the filtered coefficients of the
*              curve.
*
*
*
* INPUT      : pc1    - Pointer to the curve for which position
*                       and derivatives are to be computed.
*              ider   - The number of derivatives to compute.
*                       < 0 : Error.
*                       = 0 : Compute position.
*                       = 1 : Compute position and first derivative.
*                       etc.
*              ax     - The parameter value at which to compute
*                       position and derivatives.
*              aepsge - Geometry resolution.
*
*
*
* INPUT/OUTPUT : ileft - Pointer to the interval in the knot vector
*                        where ax is located. If et is the knot vector,
*                        the relation
*
*                          et[ileft] <= ax < et[ileft+1]
*
*                        should hold. (If ax == et[in] then ileft should
*                        be in-1. Here in is the number of B-spline
*                        coefficients.)
*                        If ileft does not have the right value upon
*                        entry to the routine, its value will be changed
*                        to the value satisfying the above condition.
*
*
*
* OUTPUT     : eder   - Double array of dimension [(ider+1)*idim]
*                       containing the position and derivative vectors.
*                       (idim is the number of components of each B-spline
*                       coefficient, i.e. the dimension of the Euclidean
*                       space in which the curve lies.)
*                       These vectors are stored in the following order:
*                       First the idim components of the position vector,
*                       then the idim components of the tangent vector,
*                       then the idim components of the second derivative
*                       vector, and so on.
*                       (The C declaration of eder as a two dimensional array
*                       would therefore be eder[ider+1,idim].)
*              jstat  - Status messages
*                                         > 0      : Warning.
*                                         = 0      : Ok.
*                                         < 0      : Error.
