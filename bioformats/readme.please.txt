I have renamed the loci_tools.jar since I want to avoid having two copies on my path. I believe that no one at LCCB is currently using this function. 
If you want to use loci_tools.jar, you have two options
1) Checkout my repository, which is going to have a very recent version of loci_tools.jar it its extern folder
2) Re-rename loci_tools.jar.old to loci_tools.jar. In this case, please send an email to jonas.dorn@gmail.com, because it may break my code.
