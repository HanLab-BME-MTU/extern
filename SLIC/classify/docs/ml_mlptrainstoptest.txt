Outline:
	We plan to run m independent networks (permutations).
	For each class n
	    Randomize the order of instances.
	    Assign the training set, stop set and test set
	    Align the target output, and class assignment
	Call to ml_featurenorm.m to normalize training and stop data.
	For 10 classes, 40 training we will have
	    trainnorm = [400 x numFeats] etc
	    where top 40 are class 1, 2nd 40 are class 2, etc.
        Call to ml_mlptraintest.m to train network
        Run the trained network with test input
	Each cell in testnetout are the results for one network
	     for our input array so we expect for example
		[0.9 0.3 0.2 ... 0.1] 1
		[0.7 0.1 0.3 ... 0.1] 1
                [0.2 0.8 0.3 ... 0.2] 2
                [        ...        ]
                [0.3 0.2 0.1 ... 0.9] 10
