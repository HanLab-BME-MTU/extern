Outline:
	Pass in features of each instance (1 feature matrix) for each of 
	 n classes. 
	A class assignment array is automatically generated. Class
	 assignment is an n class cell array. For class i, the matrix
	 in cell array i has a value 1 for every row in column i and a 0
	 otherwise.
	Desired outputs are automatically generated. Desired outputs is an
	 n class cell array. For class i, the matrix in cell array i has a
	 value 0.9 for every row in column i and a value 0.1 otherwise.
	Calls ml_mlptrainstoptest.m to train, and test a NN
	Calls ml_confmat.m to output results

Input:
	features - A cell array of feature matrices such that each cell
		 represents each class, each row of each feature matrix
		 represents each instance and each column of each feature
		 matrix represents each feature. The number of columns in
		 each matrix must be the same, althought the number of
		 rows can differ.
	subset_index - Index array of the features to use in each feature
		     matrix
	TrainSetSize - The number of instances from each feature matrix
		     for use in training the classifier
	StopSetSize - The number of instances from each feature matrix
		    for use in deciding when to stop training
	HiddenLayerSize - The number of hidden nodes
	EpochsAtOnce - Numbers of times to sweep EVERY instance for each
		      training session
        NoOfNets - Number of nets to train with variable subsets

Output:
	nn - A cell array of networks (1xNoOfNets)
	stopidx - Indices of stop samples
	confmat - 
	confmats -
	crates -
